Although the shoe comes in different colors and color schemes, the most common Air Force 1s sold are solid white (also referred to as white on white), the second most common being solid black (black on black)Another identifying characteristic of an Air Force 1 shoe is a small medallion secured to the bottom of the laces but with holes on both sides so it can be removed by sliding it off the shoe lace.[5] The medallion is engraved with the inscription AF-1, with the year 82 inscribed beside it, and has historically been made out of a silver-colored metal (perhaps pewter). Its original design was more circular, but after a redesign the Air Force 1s 25th anniversary in 2007 the medallion is now rectangular. (The redesign also involved encasing the inscription in white plastic; that was discarded in favor of the original medallion material.)"
